Where does the data come from?
==============================

> OP5 Log Analytics is a solution enabling effective data processing
> from the IT environment that exists in the organization.
>
> The Elsasticsearch engine allows building a database in witch large
> amounts of data are stored in ordered indexes. The Logstash module is
> responsible for load data into Indexes, whose function is to collect
> data on specific tcp/udp ports, filter them, normalize them and place
> them in the appropriate index. Additional plugins, that we can use in
> Logstash reinforce the work of the module, increase its efficiency,
> enabling the module to quick interpret data and parse it.
>
> Below is an example of several of the many available Logstash plugins:
>
> **exec** -- receive output of the shell function as an event;
>
> **imap** -- read email from IMAP servers;
>
> **jdbc** -- create events based on JDC data;
>
> **jms** -- create events from Jms broker;
>
> Both Elasticsearch and Logstash are free Open-Source solutions.
