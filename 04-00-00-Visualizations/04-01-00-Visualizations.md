Visualizations
--------------

Visualize enables you to create visualizations of the data
in your OP5 Log Analytics indices. You can then build dashboards
that display related visualizations. Visualizations are based
on OP5 Log Analytics queries. By using a series of OP5 Log Analytics
aggregations to extract and process your data, you can create
charts that show you the trends, spikes, and dips.
