A new page will be appearing where you can create or load
visualization.\

To load previously created and saved visualization, you
must select it from the list. In order to create a new visualization,
you should choose the preferred method of data presentation. Next,
specify whether the created visualization will be based on a new or
previously saved query. If on new one, select the index whose
visualization should concern. If visualization is created from a saved
query, you just need to select the appropriate query from the list, or
(if there are many saved searches) search for them by name.
