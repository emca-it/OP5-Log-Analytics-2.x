--------------------------------------------

In the Report selection, we have the option of setting the Scheduler
which from the previously create Dashboard template can generate a
report at intervals. The third tab is used -- Schedule Export
Dashboard.

In the Email Topic field, enter the Message title, in the Email field
enter the email address to which the report should be sent. From
drop-down list we have the option to choose at what frequency you want
the report to be generated and sent. The action configured in this way
is confirmed with the Submit button.

The defined action goes to the list and will generate a report to the
e-mail address, with the cycle we set, until we cannot cancel it with
the Cancel button.
