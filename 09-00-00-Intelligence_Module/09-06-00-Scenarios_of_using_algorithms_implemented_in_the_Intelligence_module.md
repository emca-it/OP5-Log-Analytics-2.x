Scenarios of using algorithms implemented in the Intelligence module
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Teaching MLP networks and choosing the algorithm to use:

    a.  Go to the AI Learn tab,\
    b.  We introduce the network teaching parameters,\
    c.  Enter your own prefix for the names of the algorithms you have
        learned,\
    d.  Press Build,\
    e.  We observe the learned networks on the list (we can also stop
        the observation at any moment and go to other functions of the
        system. We will return to the learning results by going to the
        AI Learn Tasks tab and clicking the show action),\
    f.  We choose the best model from our point of view and save it
        under our own name,\
    g.  From this moment the algorithm is visible in the Create AI Rule
        tab.

1.  Starting the MLP network algorithm:

    a.  Go to the Create AI Rule tab and create rules,\
    b.  Select the previously saved model of the learned network,\
    c.  Specify parameters visible on the screen (specific to MLP),\
    d.  Press the Run button.

1.  Starting regression algorithm:

    a.  Go to the Create AI Rule tab and create rules,\
    b.  We choose AI Rule, e.g. Simple Moving Average, Linear Regression
        or Random Forest Regression, etc.,\
    c.  Enter your own rule name (specific to regression),\
    d.  Set the parameters of the rule ( specific to regression),\
    e.  Press the Run button.

1.  Management of available rules:

    a.  Go to the AI Rules List tab,\
    b.  A list of AI rules available for our role is displayed,\
    c.  We can perform the actions available on the right for each rule.\
